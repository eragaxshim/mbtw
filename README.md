Mbtw is a remake of the popular Better Than Wolves (BTW) mod. Better Than Wolves (information [here](http://www.sargunster.com/btw/index.php?title=Main_Page)) was created by FlowerChild in 2011. It is a complete overhaul mod that seeks to maintain the original feel of Minecraft. It has continued to be updated ever since its release.

Unfortunately, Better Than Wolves' latest version is only compatible with Minecraft 1.5.2, which was released all the way back in May 2013. This makes it inaccessible to many modern day Minecraft players. It also misses modern day Minecraft features, which is a real shame.

Recently, FlowerChild posted a [community message](http://www.sargunster.com/btwforum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=9783) that he will most likely no longer actively develop Better Than Wolves. He also opened up Better Than Wolves to addons by relicensing it under CC BY 4.0. This allows me to use his textures and when he releases the source code, possibly also his code. Right now this seeks to be a complete rewrite from scratch, using the Fabric modloader for easy installation.

This will again be a total overhaul, meaning compatibility with other mods that change base aspects of the game will remain unlikely.

Thank you to FlowerChild for his amazing work on an amazing mod. [Minecraft Forums Link](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1272992-better-than-wolves-total-conversion)

Right now mbtw is in early Alpha, meaning there are practically no useful features. It will take a while before things like mechanical power will be added, as I might not even know how to implement those things. My first focus is the early game Hardcore mechanics, starting with stratification and ore processing.
