# ModernBTW

Mbtw (or ModernBTW) is a remake of the popular Better Than Wolves (BTW) mod for modern day Minecraft. Better Than Wolves (information [here](http://www.sargunster.com/btw/index.php?title=Main_Page)) was created by FlowerChild in 2011. It is a complete overhaul mod that seeks to maintain the original feel of Minecraft. It has continued to be updated ever since its release.

Unfortunately, Better Than Wolves' latest version (released last year) is only compatible with Minecraft 1.5.2, which was released all the way back in May 2013. This makes it inaccessible to many modern day Minecraft players. It also misses modern day Minecraft features, which is a real shame. Of course, BTW got started in part because it disagreed with modern Minecraft changes, but there in my opinion there is also a lot to love, which Better Than Wolves players will always have to miss out on.

FlowerChild posted his last [community message](http://www.sargunster.com/btwforum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=9864) in April 2021, indicating he will no longer actively develop Better Than Wolves. He has opened up Better Than Wolves to addons by relicensing it under CC BY 4.0. This allows me to use his textures and when he releases the source code, possibly also his code. Right now this seeks to be a complete rewrite from scratch, using the Fabric API. There is also a [Community Edition](https://github.com/BTW-Community/BTW-Public), which aims to build on the original Minecraft 1.5.2 codebase.

This will again be a total overhaul, meaning compatibility with other mods that change base aspects of the game is unlikely.

Thank you to FlowerChild for his amazing work on an amazing mod. [Minecraft Forums Link](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1272992-better-than-wolves-total-conversion)

Right now Mbtw is in early Alpha, meaning there are very little no useful features. It will take a while before things like mechanical power will be added, as I might not even know how to implement those things. My first focus is the early game Hardcore mechanics, starting with stratification and ore processing. Check the releases for current features.

## 1.18

Currently the mod is only compatible with Minecraft 1.16. Now that 1.18 is out, I'm making an effort to update the mod, which you can find on the 1.18 branch.

## Dependencies

Currently, Mbtw depends on the [Fabric modloader](https://fabricmc.net/), [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api), [JMX](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jmx) and [Nbt Crafting](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nbt-crafting). Installation of all three is required for Mbtw to function.
